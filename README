* README for make-common *

make-common is a makefile (common.1.mk) to be included in the primary Makefiles
for other projects.  It provides some common functionality and a uses a common
set of variables.

It will automatically generate dependency information for C and C++.

It provides a default set of variables and will try to guess the correct
directories for source, building, binaries and libraries.

It provides default rules for building C, C++, Objective-C, and Fortran that
will use the right directories for source, includes, binaries, and libraries.

See the various examples for how to use the common makefile.

The three main targets make-common provides are:
- `make env': lists the variables set in the makefile
- `make stow': Installs the package using stow
- `make dist': Creates a distribution tarball for the package
