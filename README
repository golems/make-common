** README for make-common **

* OVERVIEW *
make-common is a makefile (common.1.mk) to be included in the primary Makefiles
for other projects.  It provides some common functionality and a uses a common
set of variables.

It will automatically generate dependency information for C and C++.

It provides a default set of variables and will try to guess the correct
directories for source, building, binaries and libraries.

It provides default rules for building C, C++, Objective-C, and Fortran that
will use the right directories for source, includes, binaries, and libraries.

See the various examples for how to use the common makefile.

The main targets make-common provides are:
- `make env': lists the variables set in the makefile
- `make stow': Installs the package using stow
- `make dist': Creates a distribution tarball for the package (figuring out the distfiles from svn list)
- `make deb': Creates deb package
- `make debinstall': Creates and installs deb package


* FUNCTION LIST *

LINKLIB(name_of_binary, object files, shared libs, static libs)
ie,  $(call LINKBIN frob, foo.o, bar, bif)

LINKBIN(name_of_binary, object files, shared libs, static libs)
